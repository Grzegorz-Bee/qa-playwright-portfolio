# QA Automation Portfolio - Playwright, TypeScript, React & Python API

## 🌐 Live Portfolio

Production site: **https://qa-playwright-portfolio.vercel.app/**

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a QA-focused portfolio application together with automated coverage for both the frontend experience and the backend contact endpoint.

The stack combines:

- `React` + `Vite` for the portfolio UI
- `Playwright` + `TypeScript` for end-to-end coverage
- `pytest` for backend API validation
- `Python` + `Flask` for the contact form API served through a Vercel Function

## 🚀 What This Project Demonstrates

- Page Object Model structure for maintainable Playwright tests
- Cross-browser E2E coverage for Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- API validation for the contact form endpoint
- A hybrid frontend + Python backend setup deployed on Vercel
- GitHub Actions workflow for preview deployments and automated E2E checks

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

To work with the project locally, install:

- `Node.js` 20+
- `npm`
- `Python` 3.12 recommended (`3.9+` should work for local development)
- `pip`
- `Vercel CLI` (optional, useful when you want local parity with Vercel configuration)

## 💻 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd qa-playwright-portfolio
   ```

2. Install Node.js dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment.

   On Windows:

   ```bash
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS/Linux:

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install Python dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Install Playwright browsers:

   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

7. Start the frontend locally:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Optional: pull Vercel settings locally

If you want local parity with the hosted environment, use:

```bash
vercel pull
vercel env pull
```

Keep secrets in Vercel Environment Variables instead of committing them to the repository.

## ▶️ Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev         # Start the Vite development server
npm run build       # Create a production build in dist/
npm run preview     # Preview the production build locally
npm test            # Run Playwright E2E tests
npm run test:ui     # Run Playwright in UI mode
npm run test:unit   # Run Vitest unit tests
npm run test:api    # Run pytest API tests
npm run report      # Open the Playwright HTML report
```

## ✅ Testing

### Run Playwright E2E tests

By default, Playwright targets the deployed Vercel portfolio URL defined in `playwright.config.ts`.

```bash
npm test
```

To run against a specific deployment, set `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL` before launching the suite.

If Vercel Deployment Protection is enabled for previews, provide `VERCEL_BYPASS_TOKEN` so the tests can access the deployment.

### Run API tests

```bash
npm run test:api
```

The API tests validate `src/api/index.py` directly with `pytest`.

### Open the Playwright HTML report

```bash
npm run report
```

## 🚀 Deployment

## Vercel

The repository is configured for Vercel deployment:

- `npm run build` generates the frontend bundle in `dist/`
- `vercel.json` rewrites `/api/(.*)` requests to `src/api/index.py`
- The contact form backend runs as a stateless Vercel Function
- Preview environments can be deployed and validated automatically from GitHub pull requests

The GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/vercel-deployment.yml` does the following for pull requests:

1. Builds and deploys a Vercel preview
2. Runs the Playwright suite against the preview URL
3. Uploads the Playwright report as a workflow artifact

Required repository secrets for that workflow include:

- `VERCEL_TOKEN`
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID`
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`
- `VERCEL_BYPASS_TOKEN` when deployment protection is enabled

## GitHub Pages

The repository can also publish the static frontend with GitHub Pages when only the frontend output is needed.

## ✨ Skills Demonstrated

- Test architecture using the Page Object Model pattern
- Browser automation with Playwright and TypeScript
- Backend validation with `pytest`
- Frontend development with React and Vite
- Deployment-aware QA workflows for Vercel-hosted applications
